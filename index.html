// A - Use key events to listen for letters the user will type

// A - Build early array

// A - Display number of letters for word

// A - Current Word to Guess
//     - Show Underscore lines representing the characters to guess
//     - as the letters are correct, they fill up in the correct position of the word / phrase

// B - Letters Already Guessed
//         - Shows all letters Guessed
//         - For each letter listed, if the user hits the same key again, nothing happens

// B - when they get the word correct:
//         the image updates to that correctly guessed word
//         add word / phrase near image in big nice font

// B - Wins - # of times the user guessed the word correctly

// C - Number of guesses remaining #

// C - press any key to start the game.  Currently have it set on starting with one specific key
        // - Display the phrase on page - "press any key to get started"

//  C - Layout 

// C - image related to word
//         - Image file needs to be stored in array... or maybe name it associated to the array position, 


// D - Bonus - have a "show hint" button to get info about the movies
// - this would add more array and research work but is cool.

// D - (Consider adding a reset button)

// D - (Consider adding a "Enter your name" section
//         - Could add "Kathy's Wins" instead of just wins)
